# wallSmash
This simple game is based on the original game called "Brick Breaker". 
I am still working on some of the bugs and will update as I improve it. 
Any help is appreciated. 
A big thanks to all of the developers out there
that help beginners like me get started by publishing their work for everyone to see and learn!
CONTROLS:
-Right and Left Keys
BUGS:
The ball goes off the screen on the right side but only when going up and even with border.
The ball bounces off the right border anyother time as long as it's not going up when it intersects the right border.
